The RISC-V core, integrated with basic peripherals (GPIOs for LEDs and a UART transmitter), has been synthesized on an Intel Cyclone 10LP FPGA, achieving timing closure at 90 MHz for worst case 'Slow 1200mV 85C Model'.

The target board (Cyclone 10LP ) provides a 12 MHz external oscillator.
The internal system clock at 90 MHz is generated by inferring a PLL.

A simple UART transmitter has been integrated into the microcontroller subsystem to enable more advanced runtime testing and observability, in addition to LED-based debugging.

Timing analysis shows that the critical path is located along the expected datapath:
from the Write-Back stage, through the forwarding unit, into the ALU, and up to the EX/MEM pipeline register.

Multiple validation tests have been executed on the FPGA(located in fpga/tests), using both LEDs and UART output to observe correct behaviour.
These tests include directed programs and small application-level workloads and are documented in the corresponding folders, together with: source code, execution descriptions, and short videos demonstrating the FPGA result or screenshots.

Microprocessor_v1 is the top level in which the core has been integrated in order to use the Tx Uart and LEds as GPIOs for synthesis.
Address range given to each peripheral is the sequent:
    Data memory : 0x10010000 to 0x10011000
    LED register: 0x10010000 -> 4 bytes -> only 8 bits used since 8 LEDs available
    UART Tx Register: 0x10012000 -> 4 bytes --> 8 bits of data, 1 of 'wr_en', 1 of busy/ready
