Two type of testbenches have designed:



\-**tb\_fpga\_core** for debugging the microprocessor directed to synthesis for FPGA.



\-**tb\_microprocessor** designed specifically for testing the ISA. Allows to automatically check the success or failure of ISA tests. Used also for debugging general programs, as the ones in the tests folder.
